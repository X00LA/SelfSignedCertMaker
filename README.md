# SelfSignedCertMaker
This script creates a self-signed certificate with OpenSSL and exports it in PEM format. It checks whether OpenSSL is installed, whether the script is running with administrator privileges, and loads the configuration from an INI file. It creates the certificate, exports it in various formats, and displays the certificate details.
This script was made using Github-CoPilot to test it's capabilities.
# Usage
* Download and extract the files anywhere on your PC.
* Rename, copy or open example.config.ini
* Change the settings to your needs and save the ini file under your preferred name (your name).config.ini. The script will list all configs and you can chose which you want to use.
* Double click CertGeneratorv1.0.ps1 to start it. If it doesn't run, you have to change a setting in your Windows Settings.
